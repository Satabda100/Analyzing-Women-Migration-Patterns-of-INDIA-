# Analyzing-Women-Migration-Patterns-of-INDIA-

This study investigates the patterns and determinants of female migration 
across the 14 largest states in India, focusing on the effects of 
employment, business, education, and marriage as primary reasons for 
migration. Using data from the 1991, 2001, and 2011 census years, we 
performed a comprehensive analysis that includes subdivided bar 
diagrams, Generalized Linear Models (GLM), clustering, dendrograms, and 
QQ plots. The analysis is divided into rural and urban migration to 
capture the distinct dynamics in different geographical contexts. Our 
findings reveal significant insights into the temporal and spatial trends of 
female migration, highlighting the predominant reasons for migration and 
the variations among different states. We also assess model fit and 
distributional assumptions using heteroskedasticity tests and QQ plots. 
This study aims to provide a nuanced understanding of female migration 
patterns in India, aiding policymakers and researchers in addressing the 
socio-economic challenges and opportunities associated with migration.
